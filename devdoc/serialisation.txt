Revision of Task Serialisation
==============================

Current state:
- XML schema needs to be extended for each new task model
- Serialisation and deserialisation split in two parts:
  * Serialisation in task class
  * Deserialisation via Factory and Builder

Proposal for new serialisation: Define more general XML schema!
- Key-value map as abstract interface
- Support basic data types (int, string,...)
- Should also be able to store complex objects (i.e. key ->
  key-value-map)
- Both de-/serialisation implemented in relevant class via put/get
  operators
- Subclass implementation of de-/serialise methods must first call
  superclass method

Advantages:
- Schema can stay unchanged
- Any class can be de-/serialisable
- De-/serialisation performed in the "right place", i.e. the class
  itself, no need for builder classes (Factory must be kept!)

Disadvantages:
- XML less readable

Alternative:
- Evaluate Boost serialisation framework
